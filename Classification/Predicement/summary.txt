Summary:
----------

This code performs regression analysis on a dataset using various machine learning algorithms. 
It loads a dataset from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, trains four regression models,
tunes hyperparameters, evaluates model performance, and visualizes the results.


Libraries Used:
----------------

* pandas (pd) for data manipulation and analysis
* numpy (np) for numerical computations
* scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and utilities
	+ model_selection for train_test_split and GridSearchCV
	+ linear_model for LinearRegression and ElasticNet
	+ ensemble for RandomForestRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor
	+ metrics for mean_squared_error, r2_score, and other evaluation metrics
	+ preprocessing for StandardScaler, RobustScaler, and OneHotEncoder
	+ pipeline for creating data preprocessing pipelines
	+ feature_selection for SelectKBest and mutual_info_regression
* matplotlib.pyplot (plt) for creating scatter plots
* seaborn (sns) for data visualization
* logging for logging errors and events
* config for loading configuration settings
* os and sys for system-related utilities
